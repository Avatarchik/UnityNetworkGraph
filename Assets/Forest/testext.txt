I am always hungry
I am always free
I am always eager to play
I am not ok
I am not trying to see more
I am not trying to go there
I am not seeking redemption
I am not seeking you
I am not always hungry
I am not always ready
I am not always happy
I am certainly a ok
I am certainly free
I am certainly a home
I am certainly the sailor
I am certainly a friend
I am constantly avoiding to achieve more
I am constantly postponing to achieve less
I am constantly working to get better
I am constantly failing to get worse
I am constantly trying to get lifted
I am constantly trying to get stoned
I am constantly trying to get faster
I am constantly trying to get inclined
I am constantly trying to get up
I am certainly wrong
I will be good
I am so happy
I am so sad
I am so glam it hurts
I am so close
I am unfar
